#Livestreams

Banshee is a music ticket (NFT) marketplace that integrates livestreaming technology to deliver exclusive experiences for music fans. Through its platform, artists can create NFT-based tickets that grant fans access to live performances and other perks. The innovative aspect of Banshee’s livestreaming lies in its use of **Livepeer Studio**, a solution built on the **Livepeer protocol**, which facilitates decentralized and cost-effective video streaming.

### Key Features:
1. Token-Gated Livestreams:  
   Fans can access live performances by owning specific NFTs that act as digital tickets. These NFTs not only enable access to streams but can also serve as collectibles, fostering a closer connection between artists and fans.

2. Livepeer Protocol:  
   The platform leverages Livepeer Studio for its video infrastructure. Livepeer is a decentralized protocol for video transcoding and streaming that ensures high-quality delivery at a fraction of the cost of traditional solutions. It supports scalable and secure video streaming, making it ideal for Banshee’s needs.

3. Enhanced Fan Engagement:  
   By token-gating live performances, Banshee offers artists the ability to create exclusive, intimate, and monetized experiences. Fans enjoy a sense of exclusivity and a direct connection with their favorite performers.

4. Blockchain Integration:  
   Banshee utilizes blockchain technology for NFT creation, ownership verification, and secure transactions, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of fraud associated with traditional ticketing systems.

This approach not only redefines how artists interact with their audience but also showcases the potential of combining decentralized technology with the entertainment industry. Fans get unparalleled access to their favorite artists, while creators gain more control over monetization and audience engagement.
